      <li>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</li>
      <li>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness<br>
          and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical<br>
          problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more <br>
          likely to develop serious illness.</li>
      <li>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus,<br>
          the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your<br>
          hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.</li>
      <li>The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an<br>
          infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette <br>
          (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow). </li>
      <li>At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing<br>
          clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon<br>
          as clinical findings become available.</li></h2>
